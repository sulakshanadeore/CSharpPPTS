Programming Fundamentals

Program
set of steps written in  a specific language that will be compiled/interpreted 
 to achieve a particular result with respect to input.


Language----medium of communication used to interact between human and computer
Compiler-----compiles --- compiles the whole program in one go and lists the errors if any along with
warnings.
Interpreter----interpretes line by line, if error on previous line doesn't move to the next line for
interpretattion.
Output---- depends on the input.and thhe logic implemented for the same in the from of steps.
steps-- statements/loops/control structures etc

Programming Environment------visual Studio 2019, Visual studio code,
			sql server management studio

Compiler----

Program----Compilation---Computer binary file----- program execution
Program----Interpretation---Computer binary file----- program execution
Online Compilation------

Entry point----main()---
Comments----- developer friendly text not intended for compilation but for mutual understanding
/*  ....  */
//
Whitespaces---- tab - \t,newline \n ,space  


Basic Syntax----- strings in quotes--' or " 
		strings are long in length
                terminating character --> ;

		camelcase------ empId
                pascal case------EmpId
		snake case----emp_id
		kebab case-----emp-id

 execution-------key, command
Syntax error----rule---""---> :


Data Types ------ int,char,double,string,float,boolean,struct,


Variables------- name of the memory location which can change its value.
Constant-------- name of the memory location which canNOT change its value.

Types of Data types
a) Value----struct & enums are value types---
Stored on the stack
They cannot have null value
int i=10;
Enums----Named constants----- example: Color---
enum  inputDevices(Named constant)
{
Keyboard
Mouse
On sreen keyboard
}

inputDevices.Keyboard(0)
inputDevices.Mouse(1)
inputDevices.Onscreen keyboard(3)

-------------------------------
Types 
1) Input 
2) output




struct-----stack

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
b) Reference--- except struct & enums others are reference type
Stored on the heap
They can have null values
Arrays,
Classes
Interfaces

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Keywords----- special meaning words which cannot be used as variable names or constant names in a given language.
--------------------------------------------------
Basic Operators===> +,-,=,>,<,<=,>=,== etc.
	Arithmetic
	comparision
	Logical
	Boolean
--------------------------------------------------------
Decision Making--- control structures
if,switch case------ making decisions
Loops--- do while,while, for,for each---- repeatative tasks
Numbers----------------int,float,long, double,short

Chars------'A','B' ... Z/z
Arrays------
Strings ---------text data which is combination of many chars together

Sub-routines
--------------
1)function-------calculations and they return a value.
A retrun type like userDefined datatypes or built in data types
2)Procedures-----execution of statements that have a effect of soemthing but doesn't return any thing.
Return type--void

Files-------stream of bytes is called as file
I/O-----
Append----write
Delete
Create-----write
Search
Read file---read
if exists open
if exists false--- create


api
